⏺ Great question! This is crucial to understand. Let me explain how Elasticsearch
   combines scores when you have multiple query types with weights.

  How ES Hybrid Search Works Internally

  Step 1: Each Query Component Scores Documents Separately

  {
    "query": {
      "bool": {
        "should": [
          {
            "multi_match": {  // ← BM25 scorer
              "query": "pleural effusion",
              "boost": 0.7
            }
          },
          {
            "knn": {  // ← Semantic scorer
              "field": "text_embedding",
              "query_vector": [0.1, 0.5, ...],
              "boost": 0.3
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }

  Step 2: ES Scores Each Document with BOTH Methods

  For Document 1:
  BM25 score:      5.2  (keyword match found "pleural effusion")
  Semantic score:  3.8  (embedding similarity)

  For Document 2:
  BM25 score:      0.0  (no exact keyword match)
  Semantic score:  7.1  (very similar embedding - found "lung fluid
  accumulation")

  For Document 3:
  BM25 score:      4.8  (partial keyword match)
  Semantic score:  6.2  (somewhat similar)

  ---
  Step 3: ES Combines Scores Using Weights

  The final score for each document is:
  Final Score = (BM25_score × bm25_weight) + (Semantic_score × semantic_weight)

  Example with Weights: bm25_weight=0.7, semantic_weight=0.3

  Document 1:
  Final = (5.2 × 0.7) + (3.8 × 0.3)
        = 3.64 + 1.14
        = 4.78

  Document 2:
  Final = (0.0 × 0.7) + (7.1 × 0.3)
        = 0.0 + 2.13
        = 2.13  ← Lower despite high semantic score!

  Document 3:
  Final = (4.8 × 0.7) + (6.2 × 0.3)
        = 3.36 + 1.86
        = 5.22  ← HIGHEST! (balanced on both)

  Final Ranking:
  1. Document 3 (5.22) ← Best of both worlds
  2. Document 1 (4.78) ← Strong keyword match
  3. Document 2 (2.13) ← Semantic-only match gets penalized

  What Happens with Different Weight Strategies?

  Scenario A: High BM25 Weight (bm25=0.9, semantic=0.1)

  Doc 1: (5.2 × 0.9) + (3.8 × 0.1) = 4.68 + 0.38 = 5.06 ← WINS
  Doc 2: (0.0 × 0.9) + (7.1 × 0.1) = 0.0 + 0.71  = 0.71 ← BURIED
  Doc 3: (4.8 × 0.9) + (6.2 × 0.1) = 4.32 + 0.62 = 4.94
  Result: Keyword matches dominate, semantic matches get buried

  ---
  Scenario B: High Semantic Weight (bm25=0.1, semantic=0.9)

  Doc 1: (5.2 × 0.1) + (3.8 × 0.9) = 0.52 + 3.42 = 3.94
  Doc 2: (0.0 × 0.1) + (7.1 × 0.9) = 0.0 + 6.39  = 6.39 ← WINS
  Doc 3: (4.8 × 0.1) + (6.2 × 0.9) = 0.48 + 5.58 = 6.06
  Result: Semantic similarity dominates, exact keywords less important

  ---
  Scenario C: Balanced (bm25=0.5, semantic=0.5)

  Doc 1: (5.2 × 0.5) + (3.8 × 0.5) = 2.6 + 1.9  = 4.5
  Doc 2: (0.0 × 0.5) + (7.1 × 0.5) = 0.0 + 3.55 = 3.55
  Doc 3: (4.8 × 0.5) + (6.2 × 0.5) = 2.4 + 3.1  = 5.5  ← WINS
  Result: Documents that score well on BOTH methods win

  Why This Matters for Your LLM Agent

  The LLM's job is to predict which weighting strategy will give the best
  results:

  Query 1: "Find reports with pleural effusion"

  LLM Analysis:
  - Specific medical term ✓
  - Exact match is crucial ✓
  - Decision: bm25_weight=0.9, semantic_weight=0.1

  Why: Documents with exact "pleural effusion" text should rank highest, even if
  embeddings don't match perfectly.

  ---
  Query 2: "Cases where fluid is accumulating in the chest"

  LLM Analysis:
  - Descriptive/conceptual ✓
  - Many ways to say this (effusion, fluid, accumulation) ✓
  - Decision: bm25_weight=0.3, semantic_weight=0.7

  Why: Semantic search will find "pleural effusion" reports even though query
  doesn't use that exact term.

  ---
  Query 3: "Show me pneumothorax with large air pockets"

  LLM Analysis:
  - Specific term "pneumothorax" ✓
  - Plus descriptive qualifier "large air pockets" ✓
  - Decision: bm25_weight=0.6, semantic_weight=0.4

  Why: Need exact term match for "pneumothorax" BUT semantic helps find "large"
  descriptions.

  ---
  The Problem with Fixed Weights

  If you always use 0.5/0.5:
  - ❌ Query 1 might rank conceptually-similar-but-wrong-condition docs too high
  - ❌ Query 2 might miss valid results that don't have exact words
  - ❌ Query 3 doesn't optimize for the mixed nature

  Dynamic weights let the system adapt to each query's needs!

  Visualization of Weight Impact

  Query: "pleural effusion"

  Weight Strategy: BM25=0.9, Semantic=0.1
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Top Results:                        │
  │ 1. "...pleural effusion noted..." ✓ │  (exact match)
  │ 2. "...effusion in pleural space..." ✓│  (exact match)
  │ 3. "...bilateral effusions..." ✓    │  (exact match)
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

  Weight Strategy: BM25=0.1, Semantic=0.9
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Top Results:                        │
  │ 1. "...fluid in lungs..." ⚠️        │  (similar but vague)
  │ 2. "...chest fluid collection..." ⚠️│  (related but not exact)
  │ 3. "...pleural effusion noted..." ✓ │  (exact match buried!)
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

  So to Answer Your Question:

  "Both BM25 and semantic give results, then what?"

  Answer: ES multiplies each score by its weight, sums them, and re-ranks all
  documents by the combined score.

  The weights control which scoring method dominates the final ranking:
  - High BM25 weight → Exact keyword matches rank higher
  - High semantic weight → Conceptually similar docs rank higher
  - Balanced → Docs good at both rank higher

  The LLM's intelligence is choosing the right balance for each query type!

  Next Question for You:

  Now that you understand weight impact, do you want to proceed with adding 
  semantic search (text embeddings)?

  The implementation would be:
  1. Generate text embeddings during ingestion (add to ES)
  2. Generate query embedding at search time
  3. LLM decides bm25_weight vs semantic_weight
  4. ES combines scores as explained above




https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/retrievers/linear-retriever
Linear retriever
-> A retriever that normalizes and linearly combines the scores of other retrievers.




https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/linear-retriever-hybrid-search
this lab highly recommend linear-retriever with normalizer.


https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elasticsearch-retrievers-ga-8.16.0
-> talk about the retriever component can help you perform several tasks. not very important.




https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/hybrid-search-elasticsearch

-> talk about convex combination(CC)(the linear weight above) vs RFF
-> sparse and dense vector, what is the difference



https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag
-> RAG concept from ES 

https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/semantic-reranking-with-retrievers
-> semantic-reranking introduction


## Hybrid search
https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/search/hybrid-search
This example uses retrievers syntax with **reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)**. RRF is a technique that merges the rankings from both semantic and lexical queries, giving more weight to results that rank high in either search. 

This ensures that the final results are balanced and relevant
Outcome: RRF is often preferred when you want to make sure documents that are excellent on either lexical or semantic search are not completely buried, which can happen with simple score combination if the scores are poorly scaled.


so we would use two stage
first stage: use RRF
second stage: semantic re-ranking with google vertex ai

https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/building-multimodal-rag-system
multimodal RAG
our vision agent would have problem in merging.


3. Separate retrieval
Maintains distinct models for each modality. The system performs separate searches for each data type and later merges the results.

Advantages:

Allows custom optimization per modality, improving retrieval accuracy for each type of data.
Less reliance on complex multimodal models, making it easier to integrate existing retrieval systems.
Provides fine-grained control over ranking and re-ranking as results from different modalities can be combined dynamically.
Disadvantages:

Requires fusion of results, making the retrieval and ranking process more complex.
May generate inconsistent responses if different modalities return conflicting information.
Higher computational cost since independent searches are performed for each modality, increasing processing time.
